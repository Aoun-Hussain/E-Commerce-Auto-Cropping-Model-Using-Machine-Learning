# Ecommerce-Auto-Cropping-Model-Using-Machine-Learning
This repository consists of a python code that takes at input a raw unedited image of male and female models facing front, and outputs three images focusing on the upper body, lower body, and full body. The outputs are carefully cropped and focus more on the product, which the model is wearing, making the code suitable for E-Commerce websites and reduces the manual labour of editing thousands of pictures.
